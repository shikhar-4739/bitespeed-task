# Chatbot Flow Builder

This project aims to create a simple and extensible Chatbot Flow Builder using React. The builder will allow users to design chatbot flows by connecting multiple messages together to determine their order of execution.

## Features

- **Visual Flow Builder**: Drag and drop interface to create conversation flows
- **Node Customization**: Edit node content and properties in a dedicated settings panel
- **Real-time Updates**: See your changes immediately as you edit node properties
- **Connection Management**: Connect nodes with directional arrows to define the conversation flow
- **Persistent Storage**: Save your flows to local storage and load them when you return
- **Validation**: Flow validation to ensure proper connections between nodes

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: React framework for building the application
- **React Flow**: Library for building node-based editors and interactive diagrams
- **React Hooks**: For state management and side effects
- **CSS-in-JS**: For styling components
- **LocalStorage API**: For persisting flow data

## Development

### Adding New Node Types

To add a new node type:

1. Create a new node component in the `nodes` directory
2. Update the `nodeRegistry` in `nodes/index.js` to include your new node type
3. Add any specific styling or functionality for the new node type

### Customizing Styles

The application uses a combination of inline styles and CSS classes. To modify the visual appearance:

1. Update global styles in `app/globals.css`
2. Modify component-specific styles within each component file

## Future Enhancements

- Add more node types (input collection, condition checks, etc.)
- Implement user authentication
- Add cloud storage options
- Enable sharing and collaboration features
- Add template library for common conversation patterns
